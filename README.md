# Atari-RL-project
Reinforcement Learning For OpenAi Gym Atari Games

Project for IEORE6617 course

This project implements a deep Q learning (DQN) model for the Atari game "breakout". 

It compares the result for three different image encoder methods: 
  1. Vision Transformers with regular Attention
  2. Scalable Vision Transformers with Performers
  3. Regular CNN
